<h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>This is a place for any one-offs, test code, or educational projects.</p>
<p>As such, most all of these programs are independent of each other. Overall, this will be a 'sandbox' for me to try out whatever comes to mind.</p>
<p>As I gain more experience, I hope to start contributing, which will take place through a different organization. Serious projects may also find their way on a seperate organization</p>
